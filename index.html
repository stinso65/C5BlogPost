    <h3>Obligatory Intros:</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Tiara and as you may can tell by this website, I love to crochet! I have been crocheting since 2011 and have created a lot of cool things from patterns and from scratch (a little bit of reverse-engineering from a reference picture goes a long way). Alongside crochet, I like to go to a local anime convention that usually takes place every February. This year (2024), at the last minute (about 3 weeks before the con) I decided to cosplay as Ochako from My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Academia. To compliment the cosplay, I decided (at 3am) to crochet an amigurumi (small, stuffed toys much like a stuffed animal/character) bag! I placed my big order of Bernat Blanket yarn (because it will take A LOT less time than crocheting with medium weight yarn), galaxy fabric (to line the inside of the body), a bag of polyfil, and a 14” zipper, and practically ran (drove—there is no way I am running to a store 20 miles away) to JoAnn as soon as they opened and completed my order.
      </p>
      <p>With my materials in hand and approximately 2 weeks before the con started, I was ready to crochet her! Speaking of materials, you will need:</p>
