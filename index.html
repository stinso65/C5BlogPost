    <h3 style="text-align: center">Obligatory Intros:</h3>
      <p class="obligatory">
        Hello! My name is Tiara and as you may can tell by this website, I love to crochet! I have been crocheting since 2011 and have created a lot of cool things from patterns and from scratch (a little bit of reverse-engineering from a reference picture goes a long way). Alongside crochet, I like to go to a local anime convention that usually takes place every February. This year (2024), at the last minute (about 3 weeks before the con) I decided to cosplay as Ochako from My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Academia. To compliment the cosplay, I decided (at 3am) to crochet an amigurumi (small, stuffed toys much like a stuffed animal/character) bag! I placed my big order of Bernat Blanket yarn (because it will take A LOT less time than crocheting with medium weight yarn), galaxy fabric (to line the inside of the body), a bag of polyfil, and a 14” zipper, and practically ran (drove—there is no way I am running to a store 20 miles away) to JoAnn as soon as they opened and completed my order.
      </p>
      <p class="obligatory">With my materials in hand and approximately 2 weeks before the con started, I was ready to crochet her! Speaking of materials, you will need:</p>
    <h4>Materials:</h4>
      <ul class="materials">
        <li>9MM crochet hook</li>
        <li>2 skeins of Big Twist Plush in the color coconut</li>
        <li>1 skein of Bernat Blanket yarn in the following colors: baby pink, twilight, sparkle in hot pink</li>
        <li>2 skeins of Loops & Threads Chenille Home in the color CH04 (brown)</li>
        <li>Yarn/Darning needle (the metal curved one works best for this project)</li>
        <li>PolyFil</li>
        <li>1/2 yard of fabric (I chose galaxy print since it fits the theme of the character)</li>
        <li>Jumbo safety eyes (or black felt)</li>
        <li>Optional: light brown (matching the hair color) and light pink felt for the eyebrows and blush</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>I Did the Frustrating Part So You Don't Have To:</h3>
      <p>
        Originally, I planned to make the Ochako bag like the official Funko Pop Plush being sold in stores and online on Crunchyroll. That version has a squarer head shape and a smaller body, so I thought that it would be perfect to make the head a “storage” compartment and sew a zipper to open/close it on the back of the head underneath the hair. There were two issues with that:
      </p>
      <ul class="issues">
        <li>The head would need structural support (I have tried lining and sewing the head with canvas fabric—what a waste of time that was!)</li>
        <li>It did not look <i>right</i> to me once I made the head into a square shape. So, I settled on the (much easier) traditional round shape</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now that I have gone through the trials and errors, I started making the final project!</p>
    <h4>Abbreviations:</h4>
      <ul class="abbreviations">

        <li>Sc-single crochet</li>
        <li>Inc-increase</li>
